It looks much like a spider—what with its creepy eyes and crawly legs—but is, in fact, a crustacean. As such, the hermit crab has 10 legs and also wears a shell. But it doesn't grow this shell itself. It slips its soft body into shells left behind by snails, you see, and moves into ever-larger ones as it grows. Talk about a strange way to make a home."
