    "museum_description": "Some might say it's good luck to catch a horseshoe crab. But I am NOT among them, eh wot! Though called a \"crab,\" this beast is an arthropod and thus more akin to spiders and scorpions! Its long tail resembles a scorpion stinger, in fact! Though it's quite harmless, they say. A \"living fossil,\" the horseshoe crab has been around since before the dinosaurs. With that tank-like shell, I suppose it WOULD be the one to survive. But here's what truly rattles me to my beak... During breeding season, horseshoe crabs crawl up on the beach and make nests together in the hundreds. HUNDREDS OF HORSESHOE CRABS! And with that I can say no more."
