The arowana has been on the endangered-species list for some time. It's up to us to remain educated and do all we can to help preserve such magnificent creatures. Not to worry, old bean. This lovely fishy friend is in good wings here! On behalf of the museum, I thank you warmly for your unending generosity!"
