They may seem innocent things with their pretty white wings, but they hide a dark side! The common butterfly caterpillar is called a cabbage worm, you see, and it's a most voracious pest. The ravenous beasts chew through cabbage, broccoli, kale and the like with a devastating gusto. And my feathers! Their green coloring is truly GROSS! A hoo-rrific hue, I say."
