Of course, this briny bivalve is best known for the precious gems it grows within. The pearl-making process begins when an irritant gains access to the delicate insides of the oyster. The intruder is then covered with layer upon layer of \"nacre,\" the same substance used to create its shell. It takes years for a pearl to form, but in the end, the irritant is rendered harmless. Ahh, if only we all had the power to turn things that annoy us... into things of beauty instead."
