Not only does this shell's interior shine with a pearly luster, it features a near-perfect natural spiral. But those aren't the chambered nautilus's only bragging rights. This cephalopod can have up to 90 tentacles, it's said! These arms come coated with a sticky substance that helps the nautilus capture its prey...Which is far better than using them for overly long hugs, I say."
