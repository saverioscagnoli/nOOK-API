After seeing its dull brown shell from the outside, one would think it quite plain.But take a gander inside, and you'll see that the abalone's home is a shimmering beauty to behold! The inner layer of the shell is made of \"nacre,\" or \"mother-of-pearl,\" and, hoo, what a dazzling iridescent hue! Let this be a lesson! You mustn't judge a sea snail by the outside of its shell. Judge it by the inside of its shell instead."
