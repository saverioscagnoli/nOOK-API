In fact, some will eat creatures several times larger than themselves. To catch their prey, many of these ruthless predators spin sticky webs of surprising strength. Worse yet, they've also been known to ambush their victims, and some even chase down their meals! All this talk about the feeding habits of spiders... I'm feeling quite queasy. Hoot! The horror!"
