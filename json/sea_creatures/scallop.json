While most members of its family are known for staying put, the scallop is a nimble fellow indeed. When a hungry sea star approaches, the scallop can swim away by clap-clap-clapping its shells together! \"How does a scallop know when a predator approaches?\" you ask. Why, it has 200 eyes to see with! It makes one wonder what else the scallop sees with all those eyes... I fear it sees into my very soul!"
