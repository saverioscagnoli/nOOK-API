What a fishy paradise...until the larger fish move in and begin eating the dace! Sadly, the shiny dace are easy for other fish to spot, which makes them a popular snack. However, this particular specimen here has no need to worry. There's a strict \"No Eating Your Neighbor\" policy at this institution."
