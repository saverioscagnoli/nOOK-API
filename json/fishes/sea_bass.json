They are a varied bunch with some as small as four inches and some as staggeringly ginormous as eight feet! 'Sea bass' is a bit pedestrian though. Many species have better names, such as 'redbanded perch.' Or the delightfully whimsical dusky grouper! Or the potato cod! WILL NO ONE THINK OF THE PINK MAOMAO?!"
