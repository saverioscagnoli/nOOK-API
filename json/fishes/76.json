The benefit to the suckerfish is that it gets to eat smaller parasites and dead skin off the host's body. Amusingly, some people have used suckerfish on cords to catch large turtles with the fish's own suction! I imagine this practice is the cause of some awkward conversations between fish and turtle, eh wot"
