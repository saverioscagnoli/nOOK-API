You see, this snail carries a hard, round, button-like \"operculum\" with it wherever it goes. What is an operculum, you ask? Why, it is a trapdoor of sorts! When danger approaches, the snail slips into its shell and pulls this trapdoor closed over the opening. Thus it is locked safe and sound inside. And bravo, I say! Bravo! When trouble comes knocking, just do what the turban shell￿ does. Shut the door and turn out the lights!"
